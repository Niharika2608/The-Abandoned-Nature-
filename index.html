<h2>ARE YOU AWARE WITH THE POWER OF NATURE </h2>
        <p>When was the last time you spent time outside and enjoyed the benefits of nature
            A study in America found that most people spent a mere half-day outside each week. If you’re struggling to remember or you’ve realised that it’s been a while, you should consider shaking this up, read on to find out why.
            We love nature here at Nakd, all of our bars are formed of completely natural ingredients, just fruits and nuts smooshed together. Nature doesn’t just make a valuable contribution to our lovely bars, but it also carries many benefits for us as people which we should value. 
            Regular time spent outside in nature is key to a healthy lifestyle. Technology is improving in leaps and bounds to the point where we can experience other worlds from the comforts of our living room through virtual reality, but it will never be able to recreate the wonderful benefits the outside has to offer us.</p>

    <h2>WAYS TO ENJOY NATURE </h2>
    <p>
         1.Go for a walk or run. This is one of the simplest ways to get outside and enjoy nature. Go for a walk or a run in your neighborhood or on a nearby nature trail. Make sure you take in the nature you pass – trees, plants, and animals. <br>
    
         2.Ride your bike. If walking or running isn't quite your style, go for a bike ride instead. You can bike through your neighborhood, or even take your bike to a nearby nature trail. <br>
         3.Go for a hike. There are a lot of places where you can hike – parks, trails, nature preserves. You'll be out in nature, so it's a great way to enjoy different types of plants and animals. Hiking usually requires that you move uphill, so it's good exercise, too.</p>

    <h2>THE EXISTENCE OF NATURE </h2>
    <p>The nature of existence’ is a phrase that will mean different things to different people. To some it will bring to mind the question of the nature of our own existence. This lecture is not about that important question, but about another one: the nature of existence as such. What is it for anything at all to exist? Tim Crane addresses this question by contrasting existence with non-existence, and contrasting the kinds of properties existing and non-existing things have. He rejects the claim, deriving from Descartes and Malebranche, that nothingness can have no properties, and instead he argues that non-existing things can only have properties of one distinctive kind. This marks a difference with existing things, and tells us something about the nature of existence..</p>
